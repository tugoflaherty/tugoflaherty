## About This Portfolio:
- This portfolio represents a sample of a wide range of projects I have completed using varying programming languages and technologies.
- It is intended as a demonstration of the code behind some of the applications I have developed.
- A showcase of the 'live' versions of these applications (i.e. the interactive, working application itself) is available via my website.
- Note: This is not an exhaustive list of all projects I have developed, as for security reasons, some projects are unable to have their code made publicly available.
